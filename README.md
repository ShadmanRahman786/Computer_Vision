## **Face Detection using OpenCV and Deep Learning**

This repository documents my learning journey in the field of computer vision, focusing on face detection. The project begins with classical approaches using OpenCV’s built-in models (such as Haar Cascades) and gradually transitions to more advanced techniques involving deep learning-based face detection.

**After learning about CNN and knowing how to use it I implemented a CNN model using Simpson's dataset from kaggle to test my learning.
# Key things after implementing model was-
* It gave indepth idea about CNN and kernal is extracting features.
* The model run perfectly with an accuracy of 50% which can be improved.
