## **Face Detection using OpenCV and Deep Learning**

This repository documents my learning journey in the field of computer vision, focusing on face detection. The project begins with classical approaches using OpenCV’s built-in models (such as Haar Cascades) and gradually transitions to more advanced techniques involving deep learning-based face detection.
